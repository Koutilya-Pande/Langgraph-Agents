# LangGraph

Welcome to the LangGraph repository! This project showcases an automated essay grading system built using LangGraph and Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to evaluate essays based on multiple criteria in an educational context.

## Overview

**LangGraph** is a framework that allows for the integration of graph-based workflows with advanced natural language processing capabilities. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, LangGraph facilitates nuanced evaluations of written content, enabling a more sophisticated grading process. This system assesses essays based on key criteria such as relevance, grammar, structure, and depth of analysis.

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an essay grading system utilizing LangGraph, demonstrating how the combination of structured workflows and large language models can streamline the assessment of student writing. 

Each component of the grading system is designed to work seamlessly within the LangGraph framework, allowing for efficient processing and insightful evaluations. By automating the grading process, this project aims to enhance the consistency and objectivity of essay assessments, benefiting both educators and students.
